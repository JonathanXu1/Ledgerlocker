# Staking Protocol
We built a generic staking protocol that allows smart contract owner to earn interest while maintaining account balances.
Any DAI that is received from the smart contract can be directed to DSR where the smart contract owner is the recipient of the interest. 

We want users to keep their funds but also allow smart contract owners to monetize their services through interest.

Think POOLTOGETHER but instead the balance is going straight to the owner. 

## Use Cases

### ETHDenver Staking
The ETHDenver staking contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf4301f7f4315e98b6ecdc5df67d18f68c1e7720

The numbers: **$82,978.94** is currently staked and just sitting in the smart contract.

We are able to integrate the Staking Protocol fairly easily to manage user funds while earning interest on $82k.
With the current DSR of **7.5%**, and an assumption that the current balance will be staked for just 1 month.

$82,978 * 0.075 / 12 = **$518.61** that could be potentially earned by the ETHDenver team.
That's 25.9 **B IS FOR BUFFICORN** Books!!
